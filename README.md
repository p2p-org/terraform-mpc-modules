# MPC Cluster Terraform Modules

A comprehensive collection of Terraform modules for deploying Zama Multi-Party Computation (MPC) infrastructure on AWS. These modules enable secure deployment of threshold MPC nodes that implement advanced multi-party cryptographic protocols for secure key management, replacing traditional Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) with distributed threshold security. The infrastructure supports FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) operations including threshold key generation and distributed decryption.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This module collection enables deployment of a **decentralized, full-mesh MPC network** where each party operates as both provider and consumer in a distributed threshold key management system. Similar to blockchain networks but operating over private AWS infrastructure, each MPC node connects to all other nodes in the network.

### 🌐 **Decentralized Full-Mesh Network**

Each MPC party operates independently on its own EKS cluster and AWS account, while maintaining secure private connections to all other parties in the network. This creates a resilient, distributed system where:

- **No Single Point of Failure**: Each node operates independently
- **Threshold Security**: Cryptographic operations require cooperation from multiple parties
- **Private Network**: All communication flows through AWS PrivateLink (no internet)
- **Cross-Region/Account**: Parties can be distributed across AWS regions and accounts
- **Connectivity**: Each party establishes outbound unary gRPC client connections to other parties and runs a server to accept inbound connections.

### Core Modules

1. **📦 [mpc-party Module](./modules/mpc-party/)**: Self-contained MPC node storage and authentication for threshold cryptography
2. **🌉 [vpc-endpoint-provider Module](./modules/vpc-endpoint-provider/)**: Expose the kubernetes services as VPC endpoint services for secure MPC party communication via AWS PrivateLink
3. **🔌 [vpc-endpoint-consumer Module](./modules/vpc-endpoint-consumer/)**: VPC interface endpoints for connecting to external MPC parties

### Examples

1. **📋 mpc-party**: Deploy MPC node infrastructure for threshold key management
2. **🔗 mpc-network-consumer**: Connect to external MPC parties for distributed protocols
3. **🏭 mpc-network-provider**: Provide MPC services to other parties in the threshold network

### 🕸️ **Network Topology**
```
Party A ←→ Party B
   ↕   ✕     ↕
Party C ←→ Party D
```
Each party maintains direct, private connections to every other party in the MPC network, creating a resilient mesh topology for distributed cryptographic protocols.

## 🏗️ **Infrastructure Example: 2-Party MPC Network**

Here's a simple example of how two MPC parties establish secure connectivity:

2. **ExternalName Service** resolves to VPC Interface Endpoint DNS (this will be replaced by a vpc interface endpoint DNS in the future for TLS support)
3. **VPC Interface Endpoint** routes traffic through AWS PrivateLink
4. **VPC Endpoint Service** receives traffic in Bob's account
5. **Network Load Balancer** forwards to Bob's LoadBalancer Service
6. **LoadBalancer Service** routes to Bob's MPC Node Pod

**Inbound (Expose Alice's services):**
1. **MPC Node Pod** exposed via **LoadBalancer Service** (Type: LoadBalancer)
2. **LoadBalancer Service** automatically provisions **AWS Network Load Balancer**
3. **Network Load Balancer** connected to **VPC Endpoint Service**
4. **VPC Endpoint Service** accepts connections from other MPC parties
